## Introduction

This is a simple command-line banking application, written in JavaScript. It is a practice tech test as part of week 10 of the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) course. Development of this project is still in progress and this README will be updated in the future.


## Running the App



## Approach



## Challenges





-----
suggestions from Kay for README inclusion:
- A very brief oneliner of what the project is or does at the top of the README
- Set-up, test, running instructions in the form of commands to run in a code block, like this: https://github.com/neoeno/assembler_chat
- An image/gif of it working



------
To document:
- Do not like exposed properties outside of class( `_balance`), but necessary in order to use new Jasmine spyOnProperty functionality which only works with new getter/setter implementation (see https://medium.com/@juanlizarazo/how-to-spy-on-a-property-getter-or-setter-with-jasmine-ad06c00ba612 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44214980/define-get-set-in-constructor-function)
- Jasmine feature request submitted: https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1474
